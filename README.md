## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Font Awesome
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned to use `box-sizing: border-box;` to include padding in width calculations. This was useful for making the image and details the same width for the desktop version of the solution. This was also good practice for a number of CSS properties including Flexbox. 

```css
.details-container {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm fairly comfortable with flexbox now and planning out how to nest various div's and flexboxes to make the layouts change appropriately. One can always use more practice though.
